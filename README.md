The files in the "First Half" directory are part of a software-based graphics engine created from scratch.

The files in the "Second Half" directory integrate OpenGL into our software engine.

The "Physics" directory uses an external physics library to add physics on top of our OpenGL-based engine.

All main files should include compile instructions for macOS at the top.
